# 0x0B. SSH
# Background Context
![Alt text](image.png)
Along with this project, you have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, you will connect using ssh. But contrary to level 2, you will not connect using a password but an RSA key. Weâ€™ve configured your server with the public key you created in the first task of [a previous project](https://intranet.alxswe.com/tasks/1223) shared in your [intranet profile](https://intranet.alxswe.com/users/my_profile).

You can access your server information in the [my servers](https://intranet.alxswe.com/servers) section of the intranet, each line with contains the IP and username you should use to connect via ssh.

Note: Your server is configured with an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment.
